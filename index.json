Velero Sentinel was born out of the necessity to get informed about failed and partially failed backups made with Velero.\nThere are more elaborate alternatives out there. If you have Prometheus Operator running, you can achieve the same with a simple rule:\n1apiVersion:monitoring.coreos.com/v12kind:PrometheusRule3metadata:4name:velero5spec:6groups:7- name:velero-failures8rules:9- alert:VeleroBackupPartialFailures10annotations:11message:Velero backup {{ $labels.schedule }} has {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} partialy failed backups.12expr:|-13velero_backup_partial_failure_total{schedule!=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;} / velero_backup_attempt_total{schedule!=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;} \u0026gt; 0.2514for:15m15labels:16severity:warning17- alert:VeleroBackupFailures18annotations:19message:Velero backup {{ $labels.schedule }} has {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} failed backups.20expr:|-21velero_backup_failure_total{schedule!=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;} / velero_backup_attempt_total{schedule!=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;} \u0026gt; 0.2522for:15m23labels:24severity:warningHowever, this requires more moving parts.
